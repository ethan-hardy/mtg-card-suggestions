# mtg-card-suggestions

This is a webapp I made to solve a common problem I've had when building magic the gathering decks: I have a great theme / idea, and a good core of cards that follow that theme, but I don't have 60 cards yet. I need to fill in my deck with a couple more good cards.

With mtg deck suggestions, I (or anyone else) can enter the colours and format of my deck, and get a big list of the most played cards within those criteria.
